    "<p>We want to analyze this dataset because the data in this dataset is very clean and inclusive. 30 participants consented to submit their personal fitness data for analysis. Fitbit trackers on these participants record a lot of useful data including sleep quality data. This provides an advantage for us because we can easily correlate their sleep behavior with their daily activities to answer our project questions. Fitness data includes participants's sleep during the day, daily steps, their weights, heartrates, calories consumption</p>\n",

Jingzhi will be working on FitBit Fitness Tracker dataset while Wenhan will be working on Sleep Cycle iOS App dataset. Both datasets come from Kaggle. We will be using python as our programming language and panda,numpy,matplotlib packages will be used to analyze and visualize the data. We plan to meet twice every week, one in Wednesday morning and the other in Sunday evening to discuss our progress and share our findings. We agreed to set up a google doc to share useful resources as well as any interesting findings worth mentioning in our weekly meetings.</p>"
